class Task(object):
    """
    The base class for tasks run via :class:`Workflow` instances. Each task is run in its own process(es).
    A task represents a specific type of work. Tasks ran be executed by multiple task runners that to
    the same type of work in parallel (hence multiple processes for one task).
    Each task runner reads from one input and can write to multiple outputs. Input and outputs are configured and
    controlled by the :class:`Workflow`.

    Clients have to implement :func:`run_loop` in order to do something and to read and write to and from
    queues. Client implementations do not read directly from a task/task runners input and output but use
    :func:`get_many`, :func:`get_one`, or :func:`get_available` to read and :func:`put` to write.
    Inputs behave additively for different tasks reading from the same queue (each task
    gets a copy of all objects written to the queue). Inputs behave alternatively for the task runners of
    the same task (each runner gets some of the objects to divide the work).
    Output objects behave additively and all objects written to the same queue by all the tasks and task
    runners are send to the queue.

    The basic task/task runner lifecycle is: :func:`__init__` (parent process), :func:`configure` (parent process),
    :func:`before` (task runner), :func:`run_loop` (task runner), :func:`stop` (task runner). All state changes done in
    the task runner, will not change the state of the instance in the parent process task (the object [and its state]
    will be cloned for each task runner). On stop, task runners will close all outputs, which will
    eventually close the queue, and will cause other tasks that depend on the output of this task to
    eventually stop. Therefore, the whole workflow lifecycle is 'controlled' from the first task(s) in the workflow.
